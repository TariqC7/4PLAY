### News Feed Component
- The point of this particular feature of the app is to provide a way for our users to have access to relevant information to educate themselves about sex and overall sexual health. Although when this code is ran it will only display general news information for now because the API, (newsapi.org), in the version that we used, didn't have any available sources to pull data from to get direct news and information about sexual health.
